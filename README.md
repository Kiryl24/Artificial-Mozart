This student project was aimed to broaden kowledge about generative neural nets.
It is Long/Short Term memory net, which is splendid during generating music, because it "remembers" previous generated sequence, which is crucial during music composition.
It is toy-model, that means there are no music theory rules applied to generation or training.
Model trains on midi database found on Kaggle, in this case Mozart compositions.
It does not provide results as exact as Mozart pieces, but similarities can be spotted.
Code is written in Python.
